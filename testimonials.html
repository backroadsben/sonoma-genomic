          Direct Supervisor:

        <p>
          Ben is a great hire for any project involving the applications of oligos in Biology. I have worked with many people who consider themselves expert about oligos over the years, but Ben is head and shoulders above the rest in terms of his depth of detailed knowledge and his ability to understand the big picture. He listens, understands, and can think through all the myriad of ways things can go wrong or right and can provide clear explanations of the tradeoffs in different possible paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          One customer remarked about Ben, “it is like he can see around corners” when Ben predicted where they might have challenges before their own team did. He would always go above and beyond in ensuring the customers success whether that meant developing something new, utilizing an alternate manufacturing method or chemistry, tracking down an elusive problem, or avoiding one through the application of rare knowledge. How good is Ben’s technical knowledge? The head of oligo manufacturing would ask Ben if his own team was going to be able to do something before taking on a new task, on several occasions he corrected the chemical structures of my synthetic chemists, and he was the ultimate answer source for tech support, key accounts, and special projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ben is especially knowledgeable with assay design and test method development, and was the key person in partnering with many clinical diagnostics customers, public health agencies, and those in applied markets.
